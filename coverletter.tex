Please find my CV enclosed with my application for the position of \position.
I am excited to find job openings that explore the future of intelligent agents.

The future lies in \emph{high-level task planning combined with motion planning}.
Studies on connecting low-level sensorimotor inputs
with high-level symbolic / structured / semantic information have been gradually gaining traction.
I specialize in bridging this boundary with advanced machine learning / statistical methods,
primarily through combining generative modeling and optimized combinatorial solvers.
Such integrations are becoming even more crucial given the advent of LLMs,
which have an excellent, albeit not perfect, semantic understanding of symbolic inputs.

While being able to publish on my own consistently,
I have also been mentoring graduates \& undergraduates
from MIT and other institutions in this topic,
which has led to successful publications,
including the one that received an \emph{outstanding paper award}.
The challenge of acquiring the right talent for this task is that
it requires the skill sets from both the neural and the symbolic backgrounds.
Few academics can prepare them for it because they themselves are
often exclusively from one background or the other.

I am going to attend Neurips 2025 in San Diego this December,
during which I am available for an interview.
% It would be fortunate if I have a chance to have a conversation with some of your staff.
Thank you for the time you took to consider this application.
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
\end{letter}
