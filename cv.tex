% \section{Undergraduate Thesis Abstract}
%
% {\small
% In large-scale traffic simulation,
% microscopic multiagent model simulates the behavior of each car (an agent)
% to produce the macroscopic emergent phenomena, e.g.\  traffic-jams,
% % The accuracy of the model are validated through
% % the comparison between the k-q (traffic density to average velocity)
% % curves of simulated and actual environments.
% % which can be heavily affected by the agent behavior.
% and the development of realistic agent model is the key to maintain the simulation accuracy.
% We proposed a coorperative agent model based on Spatiotemporal RRT(St-RRT)
% and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach.
% }
%
% \section{Masters Thesis Abstract}
%
% {\small
% In Automated Planning \& Scheduling (P\&S),
% domains such as factory assembly requires the program to
% assemble many identical instances of a particular product.
% While modern classical
% planners can generate assembly plans for single instances of a complex
% product, generating plans to manufacture many instances of a product is
% beyond the capabilities of standard planners. We proposed ACP, a system
% which, given a model of a single instance of a product, automatically
% reformulates and solves the problem as a cyclic planning problem.  We
% showed that our ACP system can successfully generate
% cyclic plans for problems which are too large to be solved directly
% using standard planners.
